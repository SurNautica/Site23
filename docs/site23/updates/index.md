Understanding Updates
=====================

Site 23 uses a simple yet effective way to understand development versions. Versions consist of numbers, periods (.), and letters. Formatted like this: `0.0.0a`

### MAJOR
The initial numeral in the version denotes the "major" version, encompassing significant updates that introduce substantial and impactful content changes or releases. Most games keep this number between 0 & 5.

`x.0.0`

### MINOR
The second number in the version, commonly referred to as the "minor" number, signifies updates that introduce smaller-scale content changes, enhancements, or fixes.

`0.x.0`

### PATCH
The last number in the version, known as the "patch" version, represents updates primarily focused on addressing specific issues, bugs, or vulnerabilities. These updates typically involve minor fixes and improvements to ensure stability and enhance the overall performance of Site 23.

`0.0.x`

### DEV
Some versions are considered development testing versions, or development branches. These versions are not considered stable or production ready. You can tell if the version is a development branch by checking if the version includes a `DEV` tag.

`0.0.0 DEV`
