## Introduction

The Internal Security Department is responsible for the security of the Foundation. It is charged with the prosecution of those who breach Foundation ethical guidelines/regulations, in addition to conducting internal investigations to root out corruption and expose inefficiencies within group systems and administration.

The Department is empowered with broad authority from the Site-23 Administration to complete these objectives; however, such authority is not absolute. Transparency requirements and internal guidelines hold the Internal Security Department to a strict standard. Complaints may be levied at any time to the Office of Special Counsel, the Executive Officer or the Director of Intelligence. Questions and concerns may be filed with the Office of Special Counsel.

## Duties
### Prosecution

The ISD is obligated to prosecute those who violate Foundation ethical guidelines, regulations and rules. This duty is entrusted to the General Service Branch (GSB), and is one of the lower-level duties within the Department.

### Appeals

In the case of an unfair punishment by the Internal Security Department, a Foundation command member, or department executive, the ISD is permitted to review the punishment and reverse the punishment if deemed necessary. If an individual is found to issue many unfair punishments, they are required to be investigated by the ISD. This duty is carried out by the Office of Special Counsel.

### Investigation

The ISD is responsible for internal Foundation investigations, in addition to investigations concerning ‘groups of interest’ when deemed necessary to maintain internal security. The Department is offered broad privileges in this regard, and Agents may compel Foundation members of lower ISCL to comply with their investigation. Investigations are generally performed by the GSB.

### Reporting

The ISD is required to report activities deemed of interest to the public when;

* it is ordered by the Director of Intelligence,
* it is ordered by the Executive Officer or with approval of the Executive Officer,
* it poses no security risk to disclose (determined by the Office of Special Counsel),
* or it is mandated by a two-thirds Department Directorate vote (Confidential clearance and below).

## Rank Structure

The Internal Security Department is divided into two main groups; the General Service Branch, which handles information security, investigative and prosecutorial duties; and the Office of Special Counsel, which handles appeals, reporting requirements, and internal ethical obligations.

<h4>Branch Head</h4>

<h4>Senior Agent</h4>

<h4>Agent</h4>

## Information Security

### Overview

The Internal Security Department is charged with the Foundation’s most sensitive information. As such, security is extremely vital to the operations of the department. The ISD operates with three levels of Information Security Clearance to ensure access to classified information is kept compartmentalized and secure. Cases may also be declassified or marked as “need to know”.

### Levels

1. Unclassified/Declassified

    Unclassified/declassified documents have this ISCL assigned to them. It is not an obtainable ISCL as it simply represents no clearance. 

2. "Need to Know"

    Only the Director of Intelligence and Site-23 Administration members have unrestricted access to these documents. Otherwise, access is case-by-case per individual.

3. Restricted

    This ISCL designation is required for official entrance into the Internal Security Service and may only be obtained through direct issuance or through the Provisional Member program.

    The rank of Department Directorate typically allows access to Restricted documents and resources, however does not provide legitimate Restricted clearance.
    The rank of Site Director carries Restricted clearance.

4. Confidential

    This clearance level may be assigned temporarily or permanently.

5. Top Secret

    This clearance level is often assigned permanently.

### Disclosure Policy

The ISD is obligated to publicly disclose any investigations and the justification for punishments within six months of conclusion/issuance. Exceptions apply when “Top Secret” clearance is involved or when an exception is issued by the Director of Intelligence.
