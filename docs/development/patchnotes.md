## Weapons

!!! note "M4A1"
    - Firerate: increased from `730 RMP` to `745 RMP`
    - Damage Dropoff: reduced by `8%`

    > We felt that the M4A1 was underperforming in almost all situations, the M4A1 is meant to be the 'go-to' weapon for combatives.

!!! note "Five-Seven"
    - Base Damage: increased from `38` to `39.5`
    - Vertical Recoil: reduced by `5%`
    - Reload Speed: decreased from `3.8s` to `2.95s`

    > The Five-Seven was not a viable weapon, we hope these changes will incentivise players to use it more frequently.
