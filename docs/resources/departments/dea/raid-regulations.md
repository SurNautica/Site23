## Introduction

The Department of External Affairs was established to allow the Foundation to make relationships with external groups such as other Foundations and Groups of Interest. Any alliances made with Site-23’s Foundation are expected to maintain a certain level of activity. Forward alliance inquiries to the Director of External Affairs.

*Hostiles may capture a maximum of 200 points via hostage taking.*
