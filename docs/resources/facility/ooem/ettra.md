## Overview

The Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA) is a highly specialized agency that is dedicated to responding to catastrophic security failures in various facilities. When a critical threat emerges, ETTRA takes command of the facility to restore stability and ensure the safety of personnel and the surrounding environment. ETTRA agents are trained to assume both civil and combative command, making them capable of handling complex and high-stress situations with precision and efficiency.

The mission of ETTRA is to protect lives, secure critical Foundation assets, and restore order in the face of emergent threats. The agency operates on the principle that swift and decisive action is essential to neutralize threats, minimize collateral damage, and maintain public safety.

## Authorization

The Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA) automatically assumes comprehensive command of Site 23 in the event of unresolved threats, including entity breaches, large-scale riots, and other critical incidents. Additionally, on-site security personnel may request the assistance of ETTRA when necessary. Once ETTRA authority is granted, it can only be revoked by site administration or when ETTRA agents determine that the facility has returned to a stable state.

## Agent Authority

Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA) field agents primarily operate undercover, meaning that upon the grant of ETTRA authority, they will disclose their affiliation to on-site personnel. These agents may belong to a civil department, a combative department, or be security personnel. Once their authority is established, ETTRA agents assume equal responsibility and authority as site command. It is crucial to note that regardless of their rank, all directives and orders issued by ETTRA agents must be followed.

## Crisis Negotiation

The Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA) has established a proficient crisis negotiation team ready to be deployed upon request by security personnel, all without the necessity of initiating a full-scale ETTRA operation. These skilled negotiators remain on-site for as long as they are required by security personnel and can be promptly withdrawn if deemed unnecessary. It is crucial to emphasize that in the event of activation, negotiators possess the authority to determine if an ETTRA deployment is necessary and can initiate it accordingly.
