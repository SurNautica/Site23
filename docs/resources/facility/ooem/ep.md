## Introduction

Site 23 is recognized as a high-risk, high-security facility. Consequently, the Office of Emergency Management has developed a set of protocols and codes designed for swift communication during emergency situations. These protocols allow facility personnel to be promptly informed without the need for lengthy announcements or detailed explanations of real-world events.

To ensure the effective implementation of emergency protocols, the Office of Emergency Management has produced a comprehensive publication that provides detailed explanations and instructions for each code. This publication serves as a valuable resource for facility personnel, guiding them on how to respond appropriately in various emergency scenarios. It covers the meaning and significance of each code, along with step-by-step procedures to be followed during critical situations. By familiarizing themselves with this guide, staff members are equipped with the knowledge and understanding necessary to react swiftly and efficiently, minimizing risks and maximizing the safety of everyone within Site 23.

## Facility Emergency Protocols
### Understanding Code Announcements

During a real-world on or off-site emergency, personnel will receive a double announcement of the corresponding code, accompanied by a location if applicable. For instance, in the event of a fire within the engineering warehouse, the following announcement would be made: "Code Orange, Engineering Warehouse," "Code Orange, Engineering Warehouse." It is important to note that not all codes will be associated with a specific location, and codes without locations should be treated as affecting the entire facility.

Once an incident or emergency has been resolved, the code will be announced twice along with the location (if applicable), followed by an all-clear message. Using the previous example, when the fire in the engineering warehouse is resolved, the announcement would be: "Code Orange, Engineering Warehouse, All-clear," "Code Orange, Engineering Warehouse, All-clear." In cases where codes are activated in multiple locations, ensuring that the all-clear signal pertains to the original activation based on the location is crucial. If the all-clear is announced without a specific location or with the phrase "facility-wide," it can be assumed that the code is cleared for the entire facility.

At times, it is necessary for personnel to practice codes and protocols. During a "mock" code activation, only the personnel involved with the mock code need to respond. In most cases, mock codes can be disregarded. Mock codes will be announced three times, as exemplified by: "Mock Code Orange, Engineering Warehouse," "Mock Code Orange, Engineering Warehouse," "Mock Code Orange, Engineering Warehouse." When mock codes are deactivated, they will also be announced three times, with an "All-clear" message concluding the announcement, similar to the previous example.


### Facility Codes & Protocols

??? code-red "CODE RED - *Anomalous security breach*"

    **Overview**
    
    "Code Red" is activated when there is a breach of containment units, transport units, or the overall facility by an anomalous entity or force. This code specifically applies to breaches involving entities classified as Safe, Euclid, and Keter.

    **Procedure**
    
    1. Civil personnel
        
        1. in the event of a facility-wide breach, personnel must report to their designated emergency shelter
        
        2. locational breaches should be avoided and evacuated until the situation is secured
        
        3. directives from security personnel must be obeyed at all times

    2. Combative & security personnel

        1. are responsible for the safety of site staff at all times and should take the necessary steps to preserve life and prevent injury while ensuring that containment personnel can secure the entity without interruption or distraction

        2. containment personnel should conduct re-containment efforts in conjunction with security personnel and engineering staff

    3. Test subjects & class disposable personnel

        1. if a breached entity or force enters the CDCZ (class disposable containment zone), security personnel must initiate a lockdown and return all class disposable subjects back to their designated cells, once the entity or force has been removed from the CDCZ, the lockdown must be lifted unless it jeopardizes re-containment efforts or site security

        2. test subjects and class disposable personnel outside their designated containment zones should be either terminated (in compliance with the termination policy) or relocated to a temporary secure holding area

??? code-yellow "CODE YELLOW - *Test subject riot*"

    **Overview**

    "Code Yellow" is activated when a significant-scale test subject riot is underway within the facility. This code is specifically designed to address and manage situations where a large number of test subjects are engaged in riotous behavior that poses a potential threat to the safety and security of the facility and its personnel.

    **Procedure**
    
    1. Civil personnel
        
        1. in the event of a facility-wide riot, personnel must report to their designated emergency shelter
        
        2. locational riots should be avoided and evacuated until the situation is secured
    
        3. directives from security personnel must be obeyed at all times
    
    2. Combative & security personnel
        
        1. are responsible for the safety of site staff at all times and should take the necessary steps to preserve life and prevent injury while ensuring that the riot is suppressed and threats to the facility are neutralized 
    
        2. should suppress the riot in accordance with the riot suppression guidelines
    
        3. once a riot has been contained and neutralized, security personnel must conduct a headcount of test subjects and class disposable personnel, missing subjects must be located, arrested, and returned to their designated containment zone
    
    3. Test subjects & class disposable personnel
        
        1. compliant subjects should be returned to their cells or to a secure holding area until the riot is neutralized

??? code-orange "CODE ORANGE - *Internal fire*"

    **Overview**

    "Code Orange" is activated in the event of an internal fire within the facility. This specific code is designed to swiftly communicate the presence of a fire and activate the necessary response measures to ensure the safety of all personnel and minimize potential damage to the facility. “Code Orange” is always called with a “Code Green” announcement.

    **Procedure**

    1. Engineering personnel
        
        1. the fire rapid response team should in conjunction with security personnel start to contain the fire while evacuating and rescuing any trapped personnel

        2. subjects should be cuffed at all times when outside of their designated containment zones

    ??? code-green "CODE GREEN STAT - *Evacution (facility-wide, crisis)*"

        **Overview**

        "Code Green STAT" is an urgent code used to signify a rapid evacuation of the entire facility due to a critical and imminent crisis. This code is specifically implemented to ensure the swift and immediate removal of all personnel from the premises, prioritizing their safety and well-being above all else.

        **Procedure**

        1. Civil personnel

            1. should evacuate in a quick, calm, and orderly fashion to the civil personnel muster point “BRAVO” located at the Flags Plaza & must remain there until the all-clear signal is given

## Calling Codes & Protocols
### Locational Identifiers

These identifiers are used when calling codes and should not be used as a way to transmit your location on-site.

### Code Activation & Deactivation Guide

To activate a code, you must transmit the following message format over your radio, the channel doesn’t matter. Switchboard commands are <u>not</u> case-sensitive.

!!! note ""

    ```
    @sb CallCode <color> <LID>
    ```

To deactivate a code, you must transmit the following message format over your radio, the channel doesn’t matter. Switchboard commands are <u>not</u> case-sensitive.

!!! note ""

    ```
    @sb ClearCode <color> <LID>
    ```
