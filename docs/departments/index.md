# Departments

The Departments within Site 23 each hold a great responsibility in keeping the site protected. Entry into all *public* Departments are granted to personnel who hold a **Level - 0** clearance or higher. 

## Joining a Department

All Departments are applicable through the Site 23 Discord or within the Site 23 game. *Combative Departments* and certain *civil Departments* may hold different chances of entry, and may open/close entry when needed.

!!! note
    Foundation Personnel who hold a clearance level between 0 and 2 are granted to participate in a maximum of **2** Departments. Foundation Personnel who hold a Level - 3 clearance or higher are not permitted to join any other Department, aside their own. 
    
    *Subdivisions do not count towards the Department limit.*

## Department Categories

Each Department are given tasks and responsibilities that must be completed in a day-by-day routine to ensure the Site is capable of promising to __Secure, Contain, and Protect.__

### Civil Departments

Civil Departments are easier Departments to learn and grow, given duties around the site instead of hands on with weapons.

### Combative Departments

Combative Departments are the tougher Departments of Site 23, entrusted with protecting the Class D Containment, responding to any hostile attacks, recovering any anomalies that slip through their containment, and more.
