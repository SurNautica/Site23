# Asset Containment Unit

![ACU Logo](images/logo.png){ loading=lazy; width="150"; height="110"; align=left } The Asset Containment Unit (ACU) at Site 23 is a specialized subdivision of the Security Department (SD) entrusted with the critical responsibility of containing and securing anomalous entities and forces within the facility. With their expertise, specialized training, and advanced equipment, ACU plays a pivotal role in mitigating risks associated with anomalous phenomena.

ACU personnel undergo rigorous training in containment procedures, anomaly response protocols, and hazardous material handling. They possess a deep understanding of anomalous entities, their properties, and containment requirements. Equipped with specialized gear, containment chambers, and advanced technology, ACU is prepared to confront and neutralize threats posed by anomalous forces.

The primary objective of ACU is to safely and effectively contain anomalous entities to prevent their escape, minimize potential harm to personnel, and protect the integrity of the facility. They employ meticulous planning, coordination, and precision in their containment operations, adhering to established protocols and safety guidelines.

ACU personnel work closely with other departments, such as the Scientific Department and Medical Services, to gather intelligence, develop appropriate containment strategies, and respond to anomalies effectively. They collaborate with researchers to provide valuable insights into containment requirements and assist in the development of specialized containment procedures tailored to specific anomalies.

In the event of an anomaly breach or manifestation, ACU is at the forefront of the response effort. They rapidly mobilize, utilizing their knowledge and expertise to assess the situation, isolate affected areas, and implement containment measures. ACU personnel employ a range of tactics, including tactical deployments, specialized equipment, and anomaly-neutralizing techniques, to regain control and re-establish containment.

Furthermore, ACU is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and maintenance of containment systems and procedures. They conduct regular inspections, perform preventive maintenance, and make necessary upgrades to ensure the integrity of containment units and the facility's overall containment capabilities.

ACU personnel also play a vital role in sharing knowledge and lessons learned with the broader Foundation community. They actively contribute to research projects, share best practices, and participate in collaborative efforts to enhance containment strategies and improve overall containment effectiveness.

The Asset Containment Unit (ACU) at Site 23 exemplifies the utmost dedication, expertise, and readiness in containing and securing anomalous entities and forces. Through their specialized training, advanced equipment, and effective collaboration, ACU personnel contribute significantly to the containment mission of the Foundation, safeguarding personnel, and maintaining the integrity of the facility.
